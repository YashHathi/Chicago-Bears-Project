# Chicago-Bears-Project
This was one of the first major Data Projects I did for my Stat 107 course. While it is basic, I hope to showcase this project so years from now I can show my progress. The goal of this project was to showcase all the major topics we covered in the course.  This includes data cleaning, EDA, visualizations, introductory modeling, and finally interpreting data.  To this end, I took historical data from the entire history of the Chicago Bears (1920-2023). I got this data from this link: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/. This project was done in Python utilizing Pandas, Matplotlib, and Sci-Kit Learn.
